# Asian-Snack-Boutique
A personal project of collecting, documenting, and sorting as much snacks as possible from various Asian cultures. :)

For the backend, Node Js and Express is used to create a responsive server to interacts with user requests. Cheerio is used to scrape various websites for details on snacks. Promises are used throughout the code to ensure ansynchronous procedures. The server is connected to a Mongo Db server through a client. Data is stored in the database from scraping the websites and user input of new snacks. Additionally, data can be requested from the database through various sorting ways from the user. The front end uses a modal as user pop up and product cards to display items.
